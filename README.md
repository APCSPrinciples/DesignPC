Design Your Own PC
==================
Design your own custom computer using the [PCPartPicker website](https://pcpartpicker.com/). PCPartPicker is very helpful as it won't let you choose incompatible parts. The following components will be required for your build:
+ CPU
+ Motherboard
+ Memory
+ Storage
+ Case
+ Power Supply
+ Operating System

You are welcome to add any additional components to your build. When you are finished with your build, submit the the permalink at the top left of the page to complete the assignment.
